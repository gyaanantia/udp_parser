ADVANCED DIGITAL SYSTEM DESIGN WITH FPGAS

CATALOG DESCRIPTION: This course covers the systematic design of advanced digital systems using field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). The emphasis is on top-down design starting with a software application, and translating it to high-level models using a hardware description language (such as VHDL or Verilog). The course will focus o
